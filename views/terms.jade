					b
						| binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association 
						| (&quot;AAA&quot;) under the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), and not to sue in

					| including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, 
					b
						| except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors&#39;, our, 
						| or our licensors&#39; intellectual property rights.
				p.indent_1
					| b. 
					b Send a Notice of Dispute First.

					| send a Notice of Dispute via our 
					a(href='/contact') contact form
					|  Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. 
					| We&#39;ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start 
					| an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.
				p.indent_1
					| c. 
					b Small Claims Court Option.
					|  Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your 
					| or our county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business). We hope 
					| you&#39;ll mail a Notice of Dispute and give us 60 days to try to work it out, but you 
					| don&#39;t have to before going to small claims court.
				p.indent_1
					| d. 
					b Arbitration Procedure.
					|  The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are 
					| an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the 
					| dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, 
					| its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 
					| 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, contact the AAA and send a copy of your 
					| correspondence to us. In a 
					| dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator 
					| finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place 
					| in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or our 
					| principal place of business if your dispute is with Us. You choose. The arbitrator may award 
					| the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory 
					| or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
				p.indent_1
					| e. 
					b Arbitration Fees and Payments.
				p.indent_2
					| i. Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay 
					| the AAA&#39;s and arbitrator&#39;s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written 
					| settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to 
					| an arbitrator&#39;s decision (called an &quot;award&quot;), and the arbitrator awards you 
					| more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; 
					| (ii) pay your reasonable attorney&#39;s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses 
					| (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for 
					| investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will 
					| determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and we agree on them.
				p.indent_2
					| ii. 
					b Disputes Involving More than $75,000.
					|  The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA&#39;s and arbitrator&#39;s 
					| fees and expenses.
				p.indent_2
					| iii. 
					b Disputes Involving Any Amount.
					|  If you start an arbitration, we won&#39;t seek our AAA or arbitrator&#39;s fees and 
					| expenses, or your filing fees we reimbursed, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration 
					| frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. If we start an arbitration, we will pay all 
					| filing, AAA, and arbitrator&#39;s fees and expenses. We won&#39;t seek our attorney&#39;s fees 
					| or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining 
					| how much a dispute involves.
				p.indent_1
					| f. 
					b Conflict with AAA Rules.
					|  These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration 
					| Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.
				p.indent_1
					| g. 
					b Must File Within One Year.
					|  You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute 
					| (except intellectual property disputes—see section 10.a) within one year from when it 
					| first could be filed. Otherwise, it&#39;s permanently barred.
				p.indent_1
					| h. 
					b Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.
					|  You may reject any change we make to section 10 (except address changes) by sending us 
					| notice within 30 days of the change. If you do, the most recent version of section 10 
					| before the change you rejected will apply.
				p.indent_1
					| i. 
					b Severability.
					|  If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some 
					| parts of a dispute, then those parts won&#39;t be arbitrated but will proceed in 
					| court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of section 10 
					| is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of 
					| section 10 still applies.
				h3 Miscellaneous
				p
					| 11. 
					b Miscellaneous.
					|  This section, and sections 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, and those that by their terms apply after 
					| the Terms end will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms. We may assign 
					| these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign 
					| your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Services. 
					| This is the entire agreement between you and Us for your use of the Services. It supersedes 
					| any prior agreements between you and Us regarding your use of the Services. All parts of 
					| these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator 
					| holds that we can&#39;t enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms 
					| with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of 
					| these Terms won&#39;t change. Section 10(i) says what happens if parts of section 10 
					| (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable. 
					| Section 10(i) prevails over this section if inconsistent with it. Except for Section 
					| 10 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit; 
					| they aren&#39;t for the benefit of any other person, except for Our successors and assigns.
				p
					| 12.

					| that We shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the 
					| Unsolicited Feedback.
